            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Biography </h1><p>Roland “Malakhi” Simmons, better known to his friends as “Malakhi”, was born in
Nashville, Tenn. in 1972. The son of two artists who sought to expose him to the world of
creation: his first toys were cameras and film sets served as his playground. His childhood was
spent in Los Angeles, where his cinematographer father, John Simmons, A.S.C., introduced
him to his first love, filmmaking. As a young boy, he was brought along with his father and
fellow colleague, Carlton Moss, as the two worked on projects together. At the age of six, with
a Star Wars action figure in one hand and a Nagra in the other, Malakhi performed his first
professional job as a soundman. Through the years his various duties on set would grow.
While continuing to work under the tutelage of his father and Moss, Malakhi inherited a
passion for educational films and was inspired early on to create works rich in substance and
purpose.</p></article>]]></description>
